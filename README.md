# Disease-Variant-Classification
Exploring machine learning models and data cleaning techniques.

This is a ipynb notebook wherein I explore a dataset about disease variant classification.<br>
In the project I explored different data cleaning techniques and performed some exploratory data analysis.<br>
I also was introduced to some machine learning algorithms like: <br>
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest Classifier
- KNN
- Decision Tree Classifier
